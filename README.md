# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data using two different models: NLTK's VADER lexicon and AssemblyAI's model. Both models are used to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, providing a comparative analysis of their performance.

## Models Used
1. **NLTK VADER Lexicon**: A rule-based model for general sentiment analysis, known for its accuracy in social media contexts.
2. **AssemblyAI**: A powerful AI model for sentiment analysis, offering deep insights into the sentiment expressed in tweets.

## Features
- Classifies tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Provides sentiment scores and percentages for each tweet.
- Comparative analysis between VADER and AssemblyAI model results.

## Requirements
- `nltk`
- `assemblyai`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the script to analyze Twitter sentiment using both models.

## Note
Ensure you have an Assembly AI API key to utilize their sentiment analysis model.
While these two models provide decent outputs, better solutions might be available. If you have suggestions for improvement, please contact me.
